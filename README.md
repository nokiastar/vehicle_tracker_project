# Vehicle Tracker Project

This is a personal project where I'm learning how to:
- Build a PostgreSQL database
- Visualize data using Grafana
- Load test using k6
- Organize and track everything in a clean folder

Nothing fancy - just showing what I've been working on with help of chatgpt

## Tools used
- PostgreSQL
- Grafana
- k6
- Node.js
- VS Code

## Notes 

This isn't meant for prod or reuse. just me being a wannabe
